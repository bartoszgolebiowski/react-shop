      "description": "Document your travels with a scratch off map designed by Kristin Douglas.\n\nI am very proud of my maps.  I started making my scratch off maps by hand in 2014. I was the first to make a watercolor scratch off map and my designs have evolved since then.  I am constantly looking to make my map the best map out there.  My map is very high quality and 100% made in the USA. Seems only appropriate for a United States scratch off map.\n\nIt is a 12x18 map printed on a thick poster like material.  The background of the map is glossy so as to make for easy clean up.  The gold foil scratches off cleanly and with ease!\n\n*frame not included (12x18 frames can be found at Michaels or online at frameUSA.com)\n\nFollow my instagram for updates and promotions.   https://www.instagram.com/kristindouglasart/\n\nOther watercolor prints available:\nDreamer: https://www.etsy.com/KristinDouglasART/listing/553301580/dreamer-watercolor-scratch-off-map?utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1515704365177\nTraveling Blues: https://www.etsy.com/KristinDouglasART/listing/496878224/traveling-blues-united-states-watercolor?utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1515704384159\nPersonalized: https://www.etsy.com/KristinDouglasART/listing/490994115/personalized-been-there-scratched-that?utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1515704398102",

This wall/door/window art is attracting good dreams about: sea, ocean, summer romantic memories, turquoise shades of water, serenity. \n\nAlso this art can used as a symbol of water and money energy for feng shui followers. The fishes are great symbols of prosperity.  This item would be the perfect gift or addition to your home.\n\nI took a light plastic hoop and covered it with lace.

I used the cotton yarn of the warm sea color. 100% handmade.\n\nThe diameter of the hoop is approximately 10\u201d (26 cm) and the length from the top of the dream catcher to the bottom of the hanging string is about 25\u201d (64 cm).

      "title": "Strand of 24 Rich Honey Amber Resin Beads// Fair Trade antique amber resin beads/  imported from Kathmandu Nepal Jewelry Making Supplies",
      "description": "Strand of 24 Rich Honey Amber Resin Beads// Fair Trade antique amber resin beads/  imported from Kathmandu Nepal Jewelry Making Supplies \n\nGORGEOUS doughnut shaped amber resin beads for your jewelry making endeavors!!  To the best of my knowledge these beads date back to being made circa 1900. The photos show the crazing marks which also attest to the beads being old.\n\nPlease refer to the photos as they are an important part of the description. All weights and measures are approximate. Due to the use of a macro lens you may see details not visible to the naked eye. Color balance may differ from one computer monitor to another.\n\nDetails:\n\nBead material: Reconstituted amber with hardener added. \nBead Size: 35mm ( 1 1/4&quot; ) diameter and 15mm ( 9/16&quot; ) hole to hole\nBead Shape: Round and convex\nHole size: approximately 1.5mm\nStrand Length: approximately 19 inches\nStrand Weight: approximately 11 3/4 ounces\nColor: rich deep organic orange honey with deep yellow mottling\n\n-------------------&gt; A brass gauge is included in photo #3 for scale. What an INVALUABLE TOOL!!! If you&#39;re interested in acquiring this &quot;All Important Brass Gauge For Measuring In Both Metric And English Measure To Take The Guess Work Out Of It!&quot; click on the link below and hopefully there will still be one available, a VERY inexpensive yet Priceless investment !! Tell my sister Kathryne &quot;Serene sent me&quot; :)\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/231607290/all-important-brass-gauge-for-measuring?ref=shop_home_active_6\n\n\n The purchase of these beads helps to support families from Tibet and Nepal who have been suppressed by the Chinese military for so long. I do what I can to acquire old pieces from Tibetan and Nepalese women who are struggling to support their children. \n\nMy Fair Trade supplier &quot;on the ground&quot; acquires these beads directly from the people who craft Tibetan jewelry so there are NO sweat shops involved taking advantage of these people who are working hard to earn a fair wage and support their families. \n\nI did the standard &quot;static test&quot; with these beads,rubbing them briskly for a few seconds on a piece of wool fabric and then holding the beads over a small piece of tissue paper and the beads immediately &quot;attracted&quot; the piece of paper. Amber holds a static charge whereas plastic beads do not.  The beads are also warm to the touch, another sign of amber. \n\nI have a note posted on my Facebook Etsy page that goes into some detail about amber and how to identify it. The link is below if you&#39;re interested in reading it. I&#39;m not a scientist and don&#39;t have the skills to identify beyond a shadow of a doubt as to whether this strand of beads is made of Burmese amber, reconstituted amber or a mixture of amber and other hardening substances.\n\nMy Fair Trade vendor/supplier that I&#39;ve dealt with since 2007 referred to these as Amber Resin so I am listing them just as they were sold to me. \n\nI do know the beads passed the standard tests. I&#39;ve searched all through Etsy and found beads identical to this strand, and saw beads exactly like these selling anywhere from $30.00 to $60.00 PER bead. \n\nLink to note: https://www.facebook.com/notes/etsycomshoptemplestreasuretrove/facts-about-amber/368448973262934\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * \n\nMystical Properties:\nBecause amber, unlike other gemstones, is warm to the touch and often contains insect fragments, it was thought to possess life. It was sacred to worshippers of the Mother Goddess in classical times, as it was believed to contain the very essence of life itself - the animating principle.\n\nDue to the fact that amber is a fossil, it has associations with time, cycles and longevity. As it once was a living substance, it is related to Akasha. This is what is commonly called &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, which governs and binds together earth, air, fire and water, and in a sense it is the ultimate source of those elements. Akasha is also symbolic of life and living things; plants, animals and humans alike.\n\nAll of these mysterious properties and associations make amber one of the most widely used and prized magical substances of all times and places on Earth.\n\nYellow/Gold/Orange amber is said to enhance the beauty of the wearer. It is used to tap into the power of the Sun, and is good for success, abundance, healing, vitality and joy. It brings the energies of patience, protection, psychic shielding, romantic love, sensuality, purification, balance, healing and calmness to those who wear or carry it. It is considered a good luck charm for marriage.\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * \nHealing Properties:\n\nA powerful stone for manifestation, amber is also used for healing of the physical body as well. For over 7,000 years it has been used to stimulate the metabolism and treat skin ailments caused by a metabolic imbalance.\nBecause of it&#39;s warmth it is used also in the treatment of asthma and allergic respiratory problems. Generally wearing amber in a necklace is the most effective for this ailment.\n\nAmber carries a negative electrical energy charge and therefore is good to draw power and energy into its bearer. Amber gives a soothing, light energy that is both calming and energizing at the same time. It can help manifest desires and heighten intellectual abilities, clarity of thought, and wisdom. It cleanses its environment by drawing out negativity, and relieves physical pain the same way.\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nMagical Properties:\nEnergy: Projective \nElement: Fire, Akasha\nDeity: The Great Mother \nPowers: Luck, healing, strength, protection, beauty, love\n\nSoothing to the nerves and the spirit, as well as imparting a sense of protection, amber jewelry is appropriate to wear at any time. Said to be one of the stones in the breastplate of the high priest.\n\nUse amber to increase the strength of spells and to attract money. Added to the alter it will increase the strength of your magical spells.\n\nAmbroid (amber pressed into forms) dark red gold: calms fears and helps one keep an intellectual outlook.\n\nClear, dark red: will contain or destroy negative emotions; calms the spirit.\n\nClear golden brown: sharp intellectual focus; clears metal confusion; balances the 6th, or Third Eye/Brow Chakra.\n\nMilky golden: same as clear, but with much more inspirational energy.\n\nSea Amber (or burnite, solid, dark golden brown): helps one stay neutral and realistic in difficult situations, balances the 5th, or Throat Chakra.\n\nCleanse amber under lukewarm water, when you notice that it warms ever so slowly when you wear it or hold it. Negative energy can make amber cloudy. Never leave amber in the sun as it may become brittle.\n\n\nChakra Classification:\nHealing, soothing and harmonizing...Amber helps to stabilize the kundalini and turns the intellect into more spiritual paths.\n\nAmber is excellent for inner child work and past life work. Amber is associated with the3rd, or Solar Plexus Chakra and sometimes the 2nd, or Sacral/Navel Chakra .\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nIf you need a good excuse to purchase this piece go to the link below ;) \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TemplesTreasureTrove/about/\n\nFor more world wide treasures: \nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TemplesTreasureTrove\n\n\nThank you for stopping by to view my Strand of 24 Rich Honey Amber Resin Beads// Fair Trade antique amber resin beads/  imported from Kathmandu Nepal Jewelry Making Supplies",

Baby dream catcher comes gift wrapped and ready for giving!\n\nDimensions: ring diameter: 12 cm (4.7 inches), length: 35 cm (13.8 inches). Knitted penguins length: 2 & 3 cm (0.7 & 1.2 inches)\n\n[Keep out of small children&#39;s reach, since dreamcatcher contains small beads.]\n\n\nThe night air is filled with dreams, both good and bad. The dreamcatcher when hung over or near your bed swinging freely in the air, catches the dreams as they flow by. The good dreams know how to pass through the dreamcatcher, slipping through the outer holes and slide down the soft feathers so gently that many times the sleeper does not know that he/she is dreaming. The bad dreams not knowing the way get tangled in the dreamcatcher and perish with the first light of the new day.\n\nAlthough, dreamcatchers are not strictly supposed to be placed above a bed, but can also be used as a lucky charm in a car, on a front door or any other desired place. All of these dreamcatchers are my handmade items. Each one of them is special and unique, made with lots of love.\n\nCatch your dreams! \u2665",
